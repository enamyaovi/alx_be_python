# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON BASICS
    Hi, and welcome to my learning journey. I’ve finally updated this README at last!

    This README is a description of all the Python projects/assignments
    I am undertaking during my training with ALX Africa for Software Engineering in backend web development. 
    I’ll try to describe and explain the projects, the challenges I faced, and other insights as I work through each one. 
    Hang on tight and come along with me!

# WEEK 3: INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON BASICS
    This week’s projects were designed to test my understanding of Python and its characteristics as a high-level programming language. 
    The tasks included installing Python, setting up my preferred integrated development environment (IDE), and learning Python programming syntax. 
    I also demonstrated my understanding of the importance of indentation and code readability. 
    This week’s project aimed to lay the foundation for my Python programming journey by having me write simple programs.

# _Basic Arithmetic Operations Code Script_ [basic_operations.py]:
    This Python script performs basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication, and subtraction) using two predefined numbers stored
    in variables called number1 and number2. 
    The result is then printed on the screen using the print statement.
    It was a very basic program and easy to write—I didn’t sweat this one at all! 
    At the time, I didn’t know how to use f-strings, 
    so I concatenated strings and performed a variable conversion on the resulting float/int from the operations.

# _Simple Interest Calculator_ [simple_interest.py]
    This script followed the same theme as the previous one: writing a program to output a result based on predefined variables. 
    The catch, however, was formatting the output string. 
    The checker for this project was very particular about the figure being printed as a float to one decimal place. 
    To achieve that, I passed the final result (after calculating the product of the three variables) through the round() method (to 1 decimal place), 
    then concatenated that new value to print my desired result. As long as it worked, I didn’t bother changing it afterward.

# _Area of a Rectangle_ [rectangle_area.py]
    Nothing much to report here. Just calculating the area of a rectangle using two predetermined values.

# _Converting Hours to Seconds_ [hours_to_seconds.py]
    Similar to the previous task/project—variable assignment and understanding of arithmetic operations.

# _Future Age Calculator_ [future_age_calculator.py]
    This one was a bit more interesting to write for the first time. I played around with the input() function, 
    assigning the response to a variable that could be used later. 
    Handling user input was a new concept for me, and I enjoyed experimenting with it. 
    I also reinforced my understanding of variable type conversion. 
    Knowing that every user input is returned as a string helped a lot.
    However, I realized that if I had an uncooperative user who entered invalid data, my code wouldn’t run as intended.

# _Personal Finance Calculator_ [finance_calculator.py]
    A bonus task at the end of the first four, this wasn’t mandatory, but I had to try it out. 
    It was pretty straightforward to figure out since it built on the other projects. 
    I prompted users for some values, which I converted to integers (though I should have used float, but I didn’t).
    Then, by performing some simple arithmetic operations, I got the solution.

# _Thoughts on Week 3_
    This week was fairly easy to get through. It was fun learning new concepts and discovering all the things I could do with Python. 
    That said, the checker was a real pain to deal with! 
    My code would run perfectly in my IDE locally, but when I uploaded it to GitHub and tried to auto-review it. 
    I got flagged for all sorts of things—from whitespace issues to variable names, to enforcing some weird syntax rules. 
    I ended up committing several times to get it right.

    After completing the assignments, I revisited the projects from a different approach. 
    I studied user input handling and how to restrict users from entering invalid data. 
    I rewrote the projects to be a little tidier and tied up loose ends, 
    considering ways someone might try to break the program.
    I focused especially on [finance_calculator.py] and [future_age_calculator.py],
    defining functions and methods and applying an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. 
    I’ll link the repository to that work here [insert_link]. 
    Anyways, that’s all for Week 3. Thanks and bye!
